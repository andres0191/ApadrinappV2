What is **Apadrinapp**?

Due to the large number of people who want to belong to the wonderful family of Rappi as **Rappitenderos**, but for various reasons they lack economic resources for the acquisition of a vehicle or its documents, a cell phone, or even a data plan that allow them to connect with users, we have thought of Apadrinapp.
An application that, through **Crowdlending**, allows the collection to finance the dream of future **Rappitenderos**. Being a high risk **investment**, the interest generated for the investor will be **8%**, while the Rappitendero will have an interest charge of **10%**.

The application consists of two different profiles:
Rappitendero's Profile:
The first screen that is found is the login screen, where you can create an account by filling in the **Name**, **e-mail** and **password**, or log in by entering the **e-mail** and **password**:

When the session is already started, the menu appears, where there are two options:

For the development of this application we use the technologies of:
![img of technologies ](https://github.com/andres0191/ApadrinappV2/blob/andres/assets/readmeImages/tecnologias.jpg)
(image with firebase, react native, node js, redux technologies)

and we think the architecture in the following way:
![img of architecture](https://github.com/andres0191/ApadrinappV2/blob/andres/assets/readmeImages/Crowdlending-Rappi.png)

Once the architecture and priorities were defined on the screens that we had to develop, we proceeded to design and connect the database:

(db image)


We use firebase due to:
- Easy to use and well documented.
- High integration capabilities.
- High performance.
- Suitable for real time applications.
- Extensive functionalities.
- Support for web, Android and iOS.
- Simple control board.
